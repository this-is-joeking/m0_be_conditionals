# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
> I feel very confident in my understanding, these ones seem simple since there is so much overlap with the operators used in math. (10/10)
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
> I feel pretty confident with understanding and fluency on logical operators. (9/10)
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
>I feel relatively confident, definitely more to learn and more practice to do. Will go back later today to try the code challenges again for practice. (7/10)
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
> I spent about 2 hours on it, about double my estimate.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
> I need to practice more if statements, I have added time to my calendar at the end of the day to review those further.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> What alternative ways are there to solve the mild code challenge? I hope/expect I will find an answer from a small group member's video. If not I will ask them on slack how they solved.
